## 📌 Project Goal

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end stock market analytics and automation solution** using real-world NASDAQ historical data.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset?resource=download

The main objectives are:

- Consolidate and clean **thousands of ticker-level CSV files** (stocks + ETFs) using Excel Power Query.
- Build an **optimized data model** with Power Pivot for advanced analysis.
- Apply **Excel advanced formulas** (SUMIFS, IFS, XLOOKUP, nested IFs, upper/lower, data validation, sorting).
- Automate workflow using **VBA** and **Power Automate** for data import, refresh, and reporting.
- Perform **advanced analytics** using MySQL.
- Build **interactive dashboards** in Excel and Power BI for business insights.

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Source:** Historical daily prices for all NASDAQ tickers (up to April 1, 2020) via Yahoo Finance (Python yfinance package).  
- **Structure:**  
  - CSV files per ticker under `stocks/` and `etfs/` folders  
  - Columns: `Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume`  
  - Metadata: `symbols_valid_meta.csv` (Symbol, Security Name, ...)

- **Business Use Case:** Transform raw stock market data into actionable insights and automate reporting for investment analysis.

## 🏗 Architecture

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Import & Cleaning:** Excel Power Query imports CSVs → appends stocks + ETFs → merges metadata → transforms & cleans data.
2. **Data Model:** Load cleaned table into Power Pivot → define relationships → calculate KPIs using DAX.
3. **SQL Analytics:** Advanced queries on MySQL for cumulative volume, rolling averages, ranking, sector performance.
4. **Excel Dashboard:** Interactive dashboards with slicers, charts, conditional formatting, pivot tables.
5. **VBA Automation:** Auto-refresh data, import new files, export dashboards to PDF, trigger events.
6. **Power BI Visualization:** Dynamic dashboards with KPIs, combo charts, heatmaps, waterfall charts, drillthrough and slicers.
7. **Power Automate:** Automatically refresh dashboards when new data is added and send email reports.

## 📊 Key Features

**Excel & Power Query**
📂 As part of the ETL architecture, I designed a scalable folder-based data ingestion system where two main directories — stocks/ and etfs/ — each contain multiple CSV files, with every file representing one ticker and its historical daily price data across different dates (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume). Using Excel Power Query (Data → Get Data → From Folder), I imported entire folders at once rather than loading files individually. Power Query automatically combined the files, extracted content, promoted headers, standardized column names, converted data types (Date to Date, prices to Decimal, Volume to Whole Number), cleaned null rows, and derived the ticker symbol dynamically from the file name. This created unified, structured tables for Stocks and ETFs, enabling automated processing of newly added CSV files without manual intervention.

🔄 After transformation, I appended Stocks and ETFs into a consolidated fact table and merged it with a metadata table (Ticker, Security Name, ...) using Ticker as the join key to enrich the dataset. Instead of loading data to worksheets, I selected “Connection Only + Add to Data Model” to build a relational analytical layer. Loading to the Data Model improves performance, reduces worksheet memory usage, enables relationships, supports DAX calculations, and mirrors enterprise BI architecture. This approach demonstrates scalable data engineering practices, automated ETL workflows, structured modeling, and BI-ready dataset preparation suitable for advanced PivotTables, dashboards, and Power BI reporting.

- Import thousands of CSV files and append into a single data table.
- Data cleaning: remove blanks, errors, normalize tickers (upper/lower), merge metadata.
- Advanced formulas: `SUMIFS`, `IFS`, `XLOOKUP`, Filter, nested IFs, `UPPER/LOWER/PROPER`, Unique, `SEARCH`.
- Pivot tables, conditional formatting, data validation, sorting, and filtering.
- Calculated KPIs.

**VBA Automation**
Created automated macro system:

✔ Button: "Upload ETFs table to Database (Export to csv file & Import  into MySQL DB"
  Exports ETFs Table to CSV
  Excludes calculated columns
  Macro imports CSV into MySQL
  Automated execution
  No manual SQL needed
  Row Duplicate handling included

✔ Event-driven logic
  Clears results if ticker input is empty
  Refresh logic triggered automatically

This simulates real financial data ingestion pipelines.

**SQL (MySQL)**
Database: etf_portfolio
Table: etfs

Automated CSV export
Automated Imported into MySQL table via macro
Proper column mapping
Data types aligned

✔ Handled:
  ODBC 64-bit driver configuration
  Connector/NET requirement
  Driver troubleshooting

**Power BI Dashboards**
  Imported ETF CSV into Power BI.

✔ Steps:
Get Data → CSV
Data cleaning in Power Query (Power BI)
Built DAX measures
Created visual dashboards

Visuals Created:

✔ KPI Cards
✔ Line charts (Price trends)
✔ Column charts (Volume analysis)
✔ Slicers (Ticker, Date)
✔ Interactive filtering

✔ Why Power BI?
  Professional visualization layer
  Advanced DAX calculations
  Better executive-level presentation
  Real BI environment simulation

**Power Automate**  
(TODO)
- Trigger: New CSV or database update.
- Refresh Excel + Power Query + Power Pivot.
- Export dashboards automatically.
- Send automated email reports.
